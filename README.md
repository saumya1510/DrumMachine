# DrumMachine
(This is a work in progress)

Using the Web Audio APIs and the interfaces provided by Nexus UI, this drum machine enables users to play different beat patterns and change their tempo. 
You can play with it <a href = "https://saumya1510.github.io/DrumMachine/"> here.</a>  
Works best in Firefox..
